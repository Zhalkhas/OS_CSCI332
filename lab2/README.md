# LAB 2

This lab extends previous lab

## Reqirements

* The program must take 3 arguments: a file name, a file offset, and a string.  It should write the argument string over the chars already in the file argument filename at the argument offset.
```bash
replace filename offset string
```
* Your program must contain the following function to perform the replacement, calling it with n being the full length of the string parameter:
```C
int replace_at( int fd, off_t offset, char *s, int n );
```
This function will replace n chars from the buffer s into the file fd at the given offset, overwriting what is currently there.  It should return the new offset (just past the replaced chars), or -1 if there is an error.
* However, you should not call this function unless there are enough bytes at the offset in the file to be replaced â€“ that is, do not write before the beginning or past the original end of the file.
* Do  not use stdio functions, except you may use printf for printing messages.  
* Do not make any assumptions about the contents of the file.
